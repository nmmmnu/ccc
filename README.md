CGI-Core and ADBC

Legendary software I developed in early 1999.

In 2012 I found my source back, and made some changes in order things to get compilled with modern gcc.

In 2013 after upgrading to new gcc, I made some more changes, once again in order to get compilled without warnings.

The package includes:

- mad - general C/C++ library (http://nmmm.nu/cc/)
- coder - simple program for encode / decode between different formats (http://nmmm.nu/cc/)
- db - adbc or Abstract data base connector (http://nmmm.nu/linux/a_dbc/)
- dbtest - adbc tests
- html - html parser / convertor - strip most tags and so on.
- core - CGI Core v.3
- sudo - suexec tests
